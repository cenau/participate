## Take part in my experiment! 
Help me out with my PhD research; get hold of a friend and <a href="mailto:geraint.jones@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=Experiment signup" target="_top">sign up for my experiment!</a>

## Whats it all about?
I'm interested in the way people work together to analyse information, and how we can design systems to support this. I can tell you more after you've taken part in the experiment :-) 

You and a friend will work together to complete a simple task, then we will finish up with a quick chat about the task and your thoughts and opinions about it.

The whole thing takes 1 hour *maximum*, and we can be flexible about location and times. 

Not only will you gain my Eternal Gratitude and assist Scientific Progress, but also I can reward you with tasty baked goods/ snacks/beverages!
